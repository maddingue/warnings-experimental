NAME

    warnings::experimental - control warnings on experimental features


SYNOPSIS

        no  warnings::experimental;


DESCRIPTION

    The only purpose of this module is to have a simple way to control
    warnings on experimental features generated by recent versions of Perl
    (v5.18+), yet avoid to make the code require 5.18. This problem arises
    when coding over several versions of Perl (5.14, 5.16, 5.18), where all
    allow modern features like "given"/"when", but only the latter warns
    about it.

    Note: Remember to put the line loading this module *after* any module
    that enables warnings, like "Modern::Perl", "Moose", etc.
